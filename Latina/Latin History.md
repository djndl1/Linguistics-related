### Introduction

$\quad\quad$ Alternative hypothesis to genetic relevance: _chance similarity_, _linguistic borrowing_, _linguistic convergence_.

An example of "ne med malos tatod"

### 1.2 The IE language family

###### Anatolian

$\quad\quad$ _Hittite_, attested in the cuneiform script, the ancient Near East, dating from the 16th century BC. Palaic and Luwian attested in cuneiform, the latter also in hieroglyphic. Later in alphabetic scripts, including Lydian, Lycian and Carian.

###### Greek

$\quad\quad$ Second earliest attested, in Linear B syllabary, 14th Century BC.

###### Indo-Iranian

Indic: 2000 BC in cuneiform, major early: hymns of the Rg-Veda.

Iranian: Zarathrustra in the Avesta, around 1000 BC for the composition of the Gathas and several centuries earlier for the oldest Vedic hymns.

$\quad\quad$ Indo-Iranian, Greek and Anatolian are the three most important brances for the reconstruction of PIE.

###### Latin and the language of Italy

_Latino-Faliscan_: Faliscan 7th-6th century BC
_Sabellian group_: Oscan and Umbrian, 6th century BC
_Venetic_: 6th century BC
_Messapic languages_: greater divergence

###### Celtic

Only Irish, Scots Gaelic, Welsh and Breton surviving.

$\quad\quad$ Earliest attestations around the beginning of the Christian era.
Old Irish: 7th century AD

Subgroups: Goidelic, Brythonic, Celtiberian, Gaulish, Lepontic
It's not sure whether a continental Celtic actually reflects any linguistic reality.

######German

1000 BC, the first extensive text is the Gothic Bible translation

Old English 8th century, Old HG, Old Saxon and Old Norse the following century

###### Armenian

5th century AD Bible

###### Slavic

9th century Bible

###### Baltic

Lithunian, Latvian and Old Prussian 14-16th centuries written

###### Albanian

attested in texts from the late Middle Ages to the early modern period

### 1.3 Reconstructed PIE

Assumption: a single language was spoken at some point in time from which all the different IE varieties have evolved.

$\quad\quad$ The __Comparative Method__ operates through identification of sets of correspondence in languages which are known to be related, and forming of hypotheses to explain the correspondence.

$\quad\quad$ It is more likely that the reconstructed items are diffusely arraved in time and space and acrosss the speaker population.

### 1.4 Latin and IE

PIE

###### Phonology

$\quad\quad$ Consonats

|  Stops |

| Labial | Dental | Palatal | Velar  | Labio-velar |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| \*p    | \*t    | \*k'    | \*k    | \*k^w^      |
| \*b    | \*d    | \*g'    | \*g    | \*g^w^      |
| \*b^h^ | \*d^h^ | \*g'^h^ | \*g^h^ | \*g^wh^     |

Fricatives: \*s
Laryngeals: \*h~1~, \*h~2~, \*h~3~
Nasals: \*m, \*n
Continuants: \*r, \*l, \*y, \*w

Vowels:

​	\*e, \*o, \*a, \*i, \*u and their long counterparts
\*m, \*n, \*r, \*l as vowels

$\quad\quad$ Labio-velar in Eastern IE (Indo-Aryan, Iranian, Slavic, Baltic, Armenian) as velars or palatized velars, in WIE (Greek, Germanic, Celtic, Latin) as velars with concomitant lip-rounding or sometimes as labials

In Latin, qu- comes from \*k^w^, but g^w^ continued by w but also b (as in _bos_, normally explained as borrowings)

$\quad\quad$ voiced aspirates: voiceless aspirates in Greek, voiced aspirates in Sanskrit, voiced in Germanic, Iranian, Armenian, Baltic and Slavonic.

In Latin, fricatives in word-initial, voiced stops word-medially

$\quad\quad$ Laryngeals: trace left only in the Anatolian branch.

V+H results in long vowels except for -eH
eh~1~> Latin ē, Greek ē, Sanskrit ā
eh~2~> Latin ā, Greek ā/ē, Sanskrit ā
eh~3~> Latin ō, Greek ō, Sanskrit ā

before vowels they are generally lost except for He-
h~1~e>Latin e, Greek e, Sanskrit a
h~2~e> Latin a, Greek a, Sanskrit a
h~3~e> Latin o, Greek o, Sanskrit a

Between consonants
Ch~1~C> Latin a, Greek e, Sanskrit i, other IE branches a or lost
Ch~2~C> Latin a, Greek a, same as above
Ch~3~C> Latin a, Greek o, same as above
In Latin, vocalic m n r l developped to em, en, or ,ol respectively.

###### Latin morphosyntactic developments from PIE

$\quad\quad$ __Ablaut(vowel gradation)__ in PIE

1. Quantative ablaut: shift of word-accent within paradigm with a concomitant loss of the unaccented vowel
2. Qualitative ablaut: vowel quality change within the same syllable

\*e / \*o or \*e/zero alternation

The example of _melior_: how ablaut disappeared from PIE to Latin

###### Nominal Declensions

$\quad\quad$ The confusion of instrumental and ablative, the overlap between _origin_ of the ablative and _path_ of the instrumental,denoted by the old ablative marker
-e in the 3rd declension may originate from the old locative \*-i

$\quad\quad$ Besides dual, PIE may have a separate "collective", taking the ending of the neuter plural.
e.g. locus, loca, alongside locus, loci
	adjective in concord with two conjoined inanimate nouns of differing gender is inflected as neuter

###### The verbal system

$\quad\quad$ The difference of the Greek-Sanskrit model and the Anatolian model

Tense and mood in PIE

|             | Present stem       | Aorist stem   | Perfect stem         |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Indicative  | Present; Imperfect | Aorist        | Perfect; ?Pluperfect |
| Subjunctive | ~ subjunctive      | ~ subjunctive | ?                    |
| Optative    | ~ optative         | ~ optative    | ?                    |
| Imperative  | ~ imperative       | ~ imperative  | ?                    |
| Participle  | ~ participle       | ~ participle  | Perfect participle   |

Endings: present/imperfect = aorist

$\quad\quad$Perfects appear originally to have referred to states, and, in Greek at any rate, the productive meaning of the perfect is a state which results from a past action. Originally, perfects could be used parallel to the present tense to refer to states in the present. Relics of this situation exist in the few Latin verbs where morphological perfects have present-referring meaning, such as odi ‘I hate’ or memini ‘I remember’. 

The merger of aorist and perfect in Latin
feci, vhevhaked; peperci, parsi, parcui; pepigi, panxi

The injunctive - unmarked aorist form, originally used as a replacement for marked forms in a string of verbs.

$\quad\quad$ The unmarked present forms were lost while the aorist counterpart remained and ousted the marked form

$\quad\quad$ The first(present) and secondary(non-present)endings, not distinct in 1st, 2nd pl., 2nd sg., retained in CL. in 1st sg. person
e.g. *-ti, *-t(PIE); *-t, *-d(Latin)

###### Athematic and thematic verbs

$\quad\quad$ retained only in 1st sg. otherwise lost

###### Modal forms

$\quad\quad$ The subjunctive is often characterized as a mood of volition: it is used commands, prohibitions and exhortations, and speakers may use subjunctives to refer to events that they expect will take place. PIE subj. -> Lat. Fut.
e.g. er-it, reg-e-t, -ver-o(\*-vis-o, -vis- is a productive perfect stem)

$\quad\quad$ The optative is used in wishes, but it may be better seen as the mood of the counterfactual, or at least the mood which is further removed from the here and now than the subjunctive. PIE Opt. -> Lat. Subj.

-bo originated from a univerbation of averbal noun with the original aorist _subjunctive_, whil -bam may come from an aorist injunctive form.

###### Voice

_Medio-passive_: affectedness or involvement of the subject or functioning as the agent

$\quad\quad$The PIE _perfect_ does not seem to have made a distinction of voice

###### Syntax

Word Order: Verb-final, the unmarked word order in PIE, but textual or pragmatic factors may have led to fronting of the verb of amplification ofsentence through the addition of extra materials after the verb.

> e.g. 
>
> Manios med _vhevhaked_ Numasioi (Manius me fecit Numerio, CIL I^2^ 3, 7th cen. BC)   	
>
> eco urna _titas vendias_ mamarcos med _vheced_  
>  (ego urna Titae Vendiae, Mamarcus me fecit, Tita vendia vase, 7th cen. BC)
>
> _iouesat_ deiuos qoi med mitat nei ted endo cosmis virco sied duenos med feced en manom enom duenoi ne med malos tatod  
>  (iurat (per) deos qui me mittit, ne in te comis virgo sit, bonus me fecit in ?? bono, ne me malus clepito?) CIL I^2^ 4, 6th cen. BC
>
> hoi med mitat kauios monios qetios donom pro fileod  
> (hīc me mittit Gaius monius Cetius donum pro filio, CIL I^2^, 6th cen. BC)
>
> iei steterai popliosio valesiosio suodales mamartei  
> (ii steterunt Publii Valerii sodales Marti) CIL I^2^ 2832a, 5th-6th BC  
> The companions of Publius Valerius set up to Mars in ?
>
> esom kom meois sociois trifos audeom duom nei pari med  
> (sum cum meis sociis tribus Audiorum duorum, ne cape me) Garigliano bowl, 4th-5th BC



$\quad\quad$Verbs generally follow directly after their accusative complements. The subject follows the verb if it is especially long or complex, and dative complements also follow in all the early inscription. The rigid verb-final pattern may never have been a feature of spoken Latin.

$\quad\quad$In Platus, the verb-final order predominates in subordinate clauses, where emphasis is less of an issue. Verbs almost always follow pronomial objects. Imperatives go to the initial position. Subjects are also found following the verb particularly when the verb is passive, and where theverb is fronted or the subject is a long constituent.

### 1.5 The Position of Latin within the IE family

$\quad\quad$The IE language groups which have been spoken adjacent to the Latin speech area in historic times are Germanic, Celtic, and Greek. The features shared by Latin and Greek reflected common inheritance from the parent language, lost in other IE languages, rather than new developments.

$\quad\quad$The Italo-Celtic subgroup theory have had adherents to the present day. The most widely discussed is the o-stem genitive singular marker \*-ī, but it may be an expamle of a borrowed inflectional morph between closely related languages. The verbal endings in \*-r seemed a clear indication of a special relationship between Italic and Celtic, until the discovery of new IE languages such as Tocharian and Hittite, implying r-endings to be a retained archaism. It has been suggested that the 3rd person plural in the Italic and Celtic medio-passive conjugations derives from \*-ntro (Jasanoff 1997). The most comprehensive survey was carried out by a team led by Don Ringe (Ringe, Warnow and Taylor 2002), showing a close relationship between Italic and Celtic. There are only four features shared to the exclusion of any other subgroup.

1. The phonological change of \*pVk^w^- to \*k^w^Vk^w^-, cf. quinque <*penk^w^e;
2. The productive suffix \*-tiōn-;
3. the word for "lake", \*loku-;
4. the verb "sing" \*kan-;
